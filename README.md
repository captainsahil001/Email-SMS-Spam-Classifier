This project is an SMS Spam Classifier that uses machine learning techniques to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The model is trained on a labeled dataset of SMS messages and employs natural language processing (NLP) to preprocess the text data and a machine learning algorithm to classify the messages.
